# melodyalignment

I use it to find the optimum local alignment for two melodies (melody-strings). You can use it to compare two sequences of any format.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
